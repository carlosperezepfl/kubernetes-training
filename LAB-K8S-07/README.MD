## Secrets

Secrets allow to store and manage on a model (key/value) sensitive information**, we find there most commonly passwords, OAuth token ... 

This approach is similar to the one we have seen for configMaps, the goal is to minimize or outlaw as much as possible the secrets in plaintext in application pods or directly in images.

I've just been informed that a droid has just delivered an encoded message. 

**Let's check it out.** 

>**WARN :** Beware however, a secret is not encrypted, but simply encoded in base64, secure safe alternatives exist and MUST be used for any production-type deployment. 

 - Read | [Concepts - Secrets](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/)
 
It's time to go and see what's in this message.

Let's start by injecting it into the kube :

### Creating a Secret :

- First, add the secret-transmission-1.yml :
``` shell
kubectl create -f secret-transmission-1.yml
```
- Once deployed, it's time to see what's inside :

- According to the reports of our "Identity" service, the encoding seems to be base64, decode it!

- We have access to the Empire's internal network to find out how to decode it :
www.google.com

> base64 decode/encode

- Congratulations, it seems we still need your services, we must convey the content of this message :

> **MENACE :** 

"Please bring the Death Star plans attached to this message to {{name your planet}}"

- Encode this message and insert it in a new secret (secret-transmission-2.yml)

``` shell
kubectl create -f secret-transmission-1.yml
```

- Let's make sure it's been created :

``` shell
    $ kubectl get secrets
```
